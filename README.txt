Spencer Meldrum's COMP 20 Repository, Tufts University Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013

Favorite Project: While I thought it was quite difficult, the fully functional frogger game (#4) was extremely enjoyable to play even after I was finished, and I really enjoyed it.

Proud moment: I am most proud of my Scorecenter Web App because programming on the server was something very difficult for me to grasp and it worked out exceedingly well.

I have learned a whole slew of new things in this course, and I feel that it has been one of the most educational courses I've taken in college.  While some conceptual things still confuse me, I had a great time learning about things that are pertinent to the current software engineering world.
