Frogger (Part 2), by Spencer Meldrum

Implementation: Basic Frogger Algorithm implemented.  For additional implementations, I chose to add a timer (with extra scoring for extra time), animated the dead_frog.png on the place where Frogger has been "extinguished", and added level progression. I have also implemented a fly! (It appears way too often but it makes the game a little more fun that way by making people get a little bold >:D)
Collaborations: N/A
