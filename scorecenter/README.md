Scorecenter Web Application, by Spencer Meldrum

Help Received: Trevor John aided with initial design questions

Correct Implementations: To my knowledge, submit.json works, as does usersearch. The
requests that demanded the conversion of MongoDB information to JSON/Arrays are not
implemented correctly, as I could not find out how to do that conversion correctly.
Thus, highscores.json is also wrong.
